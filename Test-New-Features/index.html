      <p>** add the page function so people can decide the order of pages on export</p>
      <p>Ok so</p>
      <p>* Add github secret key to Noat Boat</p>
      <p>* Export from noat boat to github repo online</p>
      <p>* Netlify synced to repo and auto updates</p>
      <p>index.html would be constantly updated to contain a site map?</p>
      <p>  * next note * previous note</p>
      <p>    * so code would have to query current pages to set up new ones</p>
      <p>To share ideas etc can send from Noat Boat and would appear on site and look/feel a lot like original note- users can draw on, type, edit images</p>
      <p>Site is index.html site map and image like "Johnny's boat of noat's"</p>
      <p>On export it sends all notes in current folder with its own index.html</p>
      <p>Add more boat/fishing themes- nod to Lynch's catching the big fish</p>
      <p>*** Add live site export- just add checkbox on html website to upload to github</p>
      <p>  * then add pref to enter github secret key and repo etc</p>
      <p>I need you to add a new preference which is a field to store and save a Github Personal access token. I also need a new export option called "Publish Noat to Github"</p>
      <p>The new export option will use the Github Personal access token to access the repo the token gives access too. The exporter will check to see if an index.html is present at the root of the repo- if the index.html is not present it will create one in the root of the repo. If an index.html is already present it will use it to do its index.html functions for export-</p>
      <p>Here are the functions-</p>
      <p>The index.html at the root of the repo will be used as a visual site map with working links the user can click on to enter the various directories the export will export with this new option.</p>
      <p>The exporter will export the active note as an html website like the existing html website export except it will create a new directory at the repo root with the name of the note- then it will publish the html note + images/audio etc in that new directory like the html website export does-</p>
      <p>Then the exporter will edit the index.html at the root of the repo adding the name of the exported note as a hyperlink that links to the index.html of the new exported note directory so users can navigate through the added notes and back to the repo root note index page-</p>
      <p>On the root index.html for the repo the page will be called "Noat Boat Notes" and at the top middle of the page will be the animated ascii boat art that is currently at the bottom right corner of the application.</p>
